# ROADMAP

This document shows which we will do for next release (TODO) or future plan.

## 0.1.0

- `down` command to stop all related container
- [mitchellh/panicwrap](https://github.com/mitchellh/panicwrap) for crash reporting
- Binary release (and homebrew formula)

## Future

- Integrate docker-machine to setup docker environment not only local but some cloud provider and start k8s there
